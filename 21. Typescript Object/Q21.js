// Q.21:- They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
//  Person Object
let person = {
    name: "Qaisar",
    age: 40,
    nationality: "Pakistani",
    student: false,
};
// print Person
console.log(person);
// Car Object
let car = {
