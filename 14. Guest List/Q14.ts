// Q.14:- Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guest_list: string[] = ["mahnoor", "Maryam", "Sana"]

for(let i=0; i<guest_list.length; i ++){

    console.log('Dear '+ guest_list[i] +',\nIt is our pleasure to invite you on dinner.\nThank You!\n\n')
}
